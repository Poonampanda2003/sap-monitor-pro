# SAP Monitor Pro

🚀 A lightweight Flask-based web dashboard to monitor SAP system performance — built to automate repetitive monitoring tasks and showcase my technical skills.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**SAP Monitor Pro** is a real-time dashboard that displays system metrics like CPU and memory usage, shows alert levels (OK, WARNING, CRITICAL), and stores data in SQLite. It allows exporting performance logs to CSV and includes login protection for admin access.

This project is inspired by my daily experience as an SAP Basis Consultant, where manual monitoring is error-prone and time-consuming.
